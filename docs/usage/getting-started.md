## Creating a new website

### Option 1: GitHub Template Repo

We maintain a template repository for Home CMS which allows you to create your own site in a few clicks.

  1. Go to the [template repo](https://github.com/homecms/template)

  2. Click the "Use this template" button, or follow the [GitHub guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

The new repository that you created is a ready-to-go Home CMS website. You can move on to the next parts of this guide: [configuring your site](#configuration) and [testing your site locally](#testing-your-site-locally)

## Configuration

Your website is configured with a mix of [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) and a file in the root of the repo, which should have been created already.

There are many configuration options you can use; they're documented in the [configuration guide](./configuration.md).
